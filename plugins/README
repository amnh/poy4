The plugins in POY are functions that take user-provided arguments,
a structure of type Phylo.r, and outputs a new Phylo.r. Phylo.r has
everything the runtime system has in memory at that point (excepting
a few counters here and there).  The user-provided arguments have
the type Methods.plugin_argument (see src/methods.ml).

Once a function my_plugin_function is created, it can be registered using:

let () = Phylo.register_function "name" my_plugin_function

In this way, upon loading the plugin, it will self-register in the runtime
system. No functions to register the library from POY are provided. The function
will then be callable using the command:

name (arguments) 

where the argument structure is defined by the type that is matched by
my_plugin_function. See the example in supramap.ml for to follow better how to
do this.
