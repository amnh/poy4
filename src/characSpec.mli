(** {2 Creation, Conversion, and Builtins} *)

(** [builtin lst] returns the list of builtin functions as specified in the U
* language. *)
val builtin : string list

(** [empty] is the empty specification *)
val empty : t

(** [to_list t] returns an association list with the functions and their count
* numbers according to the character specification [t]. *)
val to_list : t -> (string * int) list

(** [join a b c d] creates a fresh character specification that merges the
* contents of the character specifications [a] and [b], and prepends the strings
* [c] and [d] to the functions and variables in [a] and [b] to avoid name
* clashes. *)
val join : t -> t -> string -> string -> SpecIndex.t -> t

(** {2 Adding Information} *)

(** [add spec name params index] adds the function [name] with parameters and types
* [params] and using the specification index [index] to the specification
* [spec]. *)
val add : t -> string -> (string * string) list -> SpecIndex.t -> t

(** [count spec name ammount] sets the total number of times the function [name]
 * was counted in the character specification [spec] to [ammount]. *)
val count : t -> string -> int -> t

(** [estimate_prob t] updates the probabilities of the functions in [t] using
* the internal counters. *)
val estimate_prob : t -> t

(** [prob spec p] sets the probability of the functions in [spec] to the
* specification of [p]. The functions must sum less than or equal to [1.0]. If
* some functions have no assigned probability, their probability will be
* proportional to their [count] and will add up to [1]. If one of the functions
* doesn't occurr in [spec], and [Undefined_Function] exception is raised. If the
* functions probabilities don't add up to [1.0], an
* [Illegal_Assigned_Probabilities] exception is raised. *)
val prob : t -> p -> t

(** [add_decoder t f] sets the length of the decoder of the functions in [t] to
* [f]. *)
val add_decoder : t -> float -> t

(** {2 Gathering Information} *)

(** [exists a b] checks weather or not a function [b] is specified in the
* character [a] *)
val exists : t -> string -> bool

(** [find_variable spec name] collects the specification information for a
* variable [name] in [spec]. The output has the same type of
* {!CharacSpec.t.variables}. *)
val find_variable : t -> string -> string * string * c * SpecIndex.s

(** [get_string c] gets the internal string representation of a function [c]. *)
val get_string : c -> string

(** {2 Complexity} *)

(** [length spec name] calculates the encoding length in nats of a function
* [name] in the character specification [spec]. *)
val length : t -> string -> float

(** [get_decoder t] gets the length of the decoder of the functions in [t]. *)
val get_decoder : t -> float

(** [k t] calcualtes the complexity of the character specification [t] in nats.

val k : t -> float
