(* The Sankoff characters have some particular properties in the tree cost
 * calculation.  Each HTU has a set of possible states, in principle, any allowed
 * state in the character could be a state in the HTU. As the tree evaluation moves
 * down in the downpass, it continues to test all the possible combinations, so
 * potentially, down in the tree, a suboptimal local solution becomes optimal. For
 * this reason, it is necessary to keep the cost of a particular character if
 * assigned on each node, and this cost corresponds to the transformation between
 * it and the optimal elements in the subtree that it roots. In reality we never
 * handle unrooted trees for this kind of operations (remember the tree module has
 * a handle for "Unrooted" trees, meaning that we can safely keep this meaning
 * properly. *)
