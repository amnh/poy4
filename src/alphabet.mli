(* Alphabet.
*
* Description and handling of different kinds of alphabets for the analysis of
* molecular data. *)

(** Alphabet specification for sequences.
*
* Sequences are usually composed of nucleotides or aminoacides. Other kind of
* sequences are valid though. This library provides the interface for such
* specifications, as well as the default ones (nucleotides and aminoacids). *)

(** {2 Exceptions} *)

exception Illegal_Character of string
exception Illegal_Code of int

(** {2 Types} *)

(** The type of the alphabet, either a sequence of integers, up to 32 elements,
* each represented by a bit, or each represented by a bit including all the
* combinations. *)
type kind = 
    | Sequential
    | Simple_Bit_Flags
    | Extended_Bit_Flags

(** Alphabet type *)
type a

(** {2 Alphabets} *)

(** [dna] contains codes for A, G, C, and T *)
val dna : a

(** [nucleotides] contains codes for A, C, G, and T, and all their possible
* combinations, including gaps, represented as "_". The alphabet used follows
* the IUPAC specification. *)
val nucleotides : a

(** [aminoacids] contains aminoacids alphabet according to the IUPAC.
* Combinations are not considered in this alphabet. *)
val aminoacids : a

(** [of_string l] creates an encoding for the string list [l] to produce an 
* alphabet. *)
val of_string : ?orientation:bool -> string list -> string -> string option -> a

(** {2 Finding} *)

(** [match_base b a] finds the code assigned in an alphabet [a] to an element
* [b]. If the element is not found raises an [Illegal_Character] exception. *)
val match_base : string -> a -> int

val gap : int

(** The obligatory representation of a gap for any alphabet *)
val gap_repr : string

(** The obligatory representation of the complement of an alphabet element. *)
val elt_complement : string

(** Same as [match_base] *)
val find_base : string -> a -> int

(** [match_base c a] finds the string representation of code [c] in the alphabet
* specification [a]. If not found raises an [Illegal_Code] exception. *)
val match_code : int -> a -> string 

(** Same as match_code *)
val find_code : int -> a -> string


(** Find  the specified complement of the element in the alphabet. If no
* complement is specified, return None. *)
val complement : int -> a -> int option

(** [rnd a] creates a function that generates random elements in the alphabet
* [a] *)
val rnd : a -> (unit -> int)

(** {2 Alphabets Properties} *)

(** [size a] gets the size of the alphabet [a]. *)
val size : a -> int

(** [get_all a] returns the assigned code to represent all the elements in the
* alphabet [a]. *)
val get_all : a -> int option

(** [get_gap a] returns the assigned code to represent the gap element in the
* alphabet [a]. *)
val get_gap : a -> int

(** [kind a] returns the kind of the alphabet [a]. *)
val kind : a -> kind

(** [distinct_size a] returns the number of distinguishable elements in [a]. Two
* elements are distinguishable if their codes are different. *)
val distinct_size : a -> int

val print : a -> unit

(** {2 Extracting and Generating Alphabets} *)

(** [list_to_a l g a k] generate an alphabet using the association
* list of strings, codes, and optional complements [l], with gap
code [g] and all code [a], to create * an alphabet of kind [k] *)
val list_to_a :
  (string * int * int option) list -> string -> string option -> kind -> a

(** [simplify a] return an alphabet with the following conditions:
* If the kind of [a] is [Sequential] or [Simple_Bit_Flags], then the same 
* alphabet is returned, otherwise, only the bit flags, and the all elements are
* returned in a fresh alphabet, of type [Simple_Bit_Flags]. *)
val simplify : a -> a 

(** [to_sequential a] returns an alphabet of any kind, with its elements
* represented in the simplified Sequential kind representation. *)
val to_sequential : a -> a

(** [explote a] takes an alphabet of any [kind] and generates an
* [Extended_Bit_Flags] alphabet, where every combination is represented within
* square brackets. *)
val explote : a -> a

val to_list : a -> (string * int) list

(** [to_formatter a] produce a text-only representation of the alphabet [a].
* Useful for uniform end-user reporting. *)
val to_formatter : a -> Tags.output

module Lexer : sig

    (* The returned list is in the inverse order of the stream. It is done like
    * this because the sequences are loaded by prepending, so there is no need
    * to hit the performance by keeping the order of the sequences being read.
    * The boolean argument is used to issue error warnings (true) or not
    * (false). *)
    val make_lexer : 
        bool -> a -> (char Stream.t -> int list -> int -> int list * int)

    (** Simmilar to [make_lexer] with two main differences: 0) first argument
    * specifies the polymorphic style according to the file format i) second argument is
    * a boolean for whether or not it should respect the case of the alphabet,
    * and ii) it doesn't consume the entire stream but returns one element at a
    * time. The list of elements is returned because a small set of alphabet
    * elements can be enclosed inside {} or (). *)
    val make_simplified_lexer : [ `Nexus | `Hennig | `None ] -> 
        bool -> bool -> a -> (char Stream.t -> int list)
