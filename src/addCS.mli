(** Additive Character Sets. 
*
* The additive character type has some properties that make it nicer to
* implement in group in C. For this reason a specific library for this kind of
* character was implemented in POY. The current interface follows the complete
* Set.Make specification so that it can be used as a functor parameter for set
* in scalable character sets. *)

(** {2 Exceptions} *)

exception Exists
exception Illegal_Arguments
exception Duplicated
exception Illegal_State
exception Not_Found

(** {2 Types} *)

(** A set of additive characters. Each character is defined with a minimum a
* maximum and a code. In a set, not two elements share a code, and most of the
* operations are only allowed if the sets involved share the set of codes of
* their respective characters. *)
type t

(**[min * max * code] defines the set of valid possible states in a character
* assignation, where [min] is the lower limit, [max] is the upper limit of the
* segment of states assigned and [min] <= [max], and code is the assigned code
* to the character. *)
type c = int * int * int

(** {2 Creation and Conversion } *)

(**[of_array a k] creates a new set of characters containing the characters in
 * [x] with code [k]. The function [raise Duplicated] if there is a duplicated code in the
 * array, and [raise Illegal_State] if [max] < [min] (See {!Char_addc.c}.).*)
val of_array : c array -> int -> t

(**[of_list a k] creates a new set of characters containing the characters in

val clone : t -> t 

(** {2 Distance and Medians} *)

(** [compare_codes a b] returns [0] if a and b share the same character codes in their
* sets, [-1] if for the first character with code in [a] different from [b] the
* code in [a] is less than in [b], otherwise returns [1]. This is a horrible
* description, so in other words, they are compared in lexicographic order
* according to the codes of the characters they contain. *)
val compare_codes : t -> t -> int 

(** [compare_data a b] performs a lexicographic comparison of sequences [a] and
* [b], returning [0] if [a = b], [>0] if [a > b] and otherwise [<0]. *)

 * state of the characters to perform the remotion. *)
val remove : c -> t -> t

(** [union a b] creates a fresh additive character set containing the elements
* of [a] and [b] and set code of b. If a particular code is contained in both [a] 
* and [b] the state of the corresponding code in the output set is the one found
