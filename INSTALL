In order to compile POY, the minimal requirements are:

- Objective Caml (version 3.09.3 recommended), which can be found in
  http://www.ocaml.org.

- A C compiler (gcc > 3.4.1 recommended).

- The GNU Make toolbox (version 3.80).

To compile the program, first modify the relevant paths and options in config 
(there is a brief description on each group of options or you can see the
program's documentation), and then simply:

make clean
make depend
make mpoy.opt

you will find the executable program in src/mpoy.opt.

Enjoy!
