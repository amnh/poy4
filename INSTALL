In order to compile POY, the minimal requirements are:

- Objective Caml version 3.10.0, which can be found in
  http://www.ocaml.org.

- An ISO 99 C compiler.

- The GNU Make toolbox (version 3.80).

- Readline or ncurses

To compile the program, first modify the relevant paths and options in config 
(there is a brief description on each group of options or you can see the
program's documentation), and then simply:

./configure
make 
make install 

The last command should probably be run as superuser. Check the configuration
options with ./configure --help.

Enjoy!
